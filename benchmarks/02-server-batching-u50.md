# 02 - Continuous batching under load (u50)

Host `Windows-AMD64` · `--parallel 4` · 15 samples over
60s at 2.0s intervals · raw CSV: `02-server-metrics-u50.csv`

| Gauge | Peak observed |
|:--|--:|
| `n_busy_slots_per_decode` (avg/decode) | 4.00 of 4 slots (100%) |
| `requests_processing` | 4 |
| `requests_deferred` | 45 |
| `kv_cache_usage_ratio` | n/a — not exported by llama.cpp `b10488` |
| `tokens_predicted_total` (final) | 10722 |

Highest sampled value was **4.00 of 4** slots. Note this gauge is llama.cpp's *average* busy slots per decode step, so the number below is the highest average we sampled, not an instantaneous maximum batch width. A peak near 1 means
requests were served one at a time -- either the load was too light to overlap, or
they arrived too far apart. A peak approaching `--parallel` means the scheduler was
genuinely packing concurrent requests into shared decode steps.
`requests_deferred` went above zero: more requests arrived than there were slots, so some waited. That wait is the queue time in your P95.

## Your observation

The peak batch width was 4.00 out of 4 slots. This confirms the server was fully utilizing its batching capacity. However, effective concurrency was 41.9. I trust both: batch width is bounded by `--parallel 4`, meaning only 4 requests are actively processed at once. The remaining requests (up to 45 deferred) wait in the queue, which explains the high effective concurrency of 41.9.

_What was the peak batch width, and does it match the effective concurrency in
`02-server-results.md`? If the two disagree, which do you trust and why?_
